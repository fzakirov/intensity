## Intensity

Here is the basic analysis for EEG auditory ERP analysis in MNE Python. Notebooks here are mainly related to the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) paradigm (Hegerl & Juckel, 1993) in adults and kids. EEG used in this code are recordings obtained with 32-ch Neurotravel (kids) and 64-ch BrainProducts (adults) setups.

```funcs.py``` contains some useful functions used in the analysis.

This code was used for LDAEP estimation in the following paper of our group:
